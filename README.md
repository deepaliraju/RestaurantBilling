# RetailStoreBilling
a queue and billing management system
# Aim
To help with the billing and queue management of a retail store using C.
# Description
It helps with the smooth flow of customers in the queue without any hassle.
# PROBLEM DEFINITION
In this problem , we focus on the queue management system in a retail shop.We develop a code to manage the limit of people standing in a queue,for knowing the wait time and when a customer must go to the POS terminal and also the billing taking place at the POS terminal.
# APPROACH TO PROBLEM SOLVING
We thought of solving the problem using queues where the first person in the queue is the first person to leave.
The capacity of each queue is 4 people. If a queue is filled they are sent to the next POS terminal.We have a total of 5 POS terminals ad with a capacity of 4 people each.
# ASSUMPTIONS
We assume the number of people in the retail shop to be limited. 
# LIMITATIONS 
The customer can buy only one item of a particular type , the items available in our retail shop are toothbrush, soap, towel, doormat and airfreshner , the customer can only buy any one of these. 
# KNOWN DEFECTS IN THE SOLUTION
A large amount of people cannot be managed , maximum capacity is 5 terminals * 4 people in each queue=20 people at most.
Only one item can be selected at a time.
